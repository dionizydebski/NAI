South Africa has one of the most developed road networks in Africa but one of the worst safety records.[4] During the four-day-long Easter weekend in 2023, the country recorded 185 fatal automobile incidents that resulted in 225 fatalities.[5] In a statement made hours before the crash, President Cyril Ramaphosa urged South Africans to take caution on the roads during the Easter weekend: "Let's do our best to make this a safe Easter. Easter does not have to be a time where we sit back and wait to see statistics on tragedy or injuries on our roads."[5]

The Zion Christian Church, the largest denomination in southern Africa, is headquartered in Moria and attracts millions of Christians from South Africa and surrounding countries with its annual Easter pilgrimages.[6] The 2024 pilgrimage is the first in the town since the COVID-19 pandemic.[7][8]
